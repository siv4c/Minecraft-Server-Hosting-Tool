# Minecraft Server Hosting Tool

Easily grab the latest server.jar from Mojang, as well as the ngrok agent for simple port-forwading

ngrok creates a TCP tunnel to share your server with others. The free version of ngrok does not allow you to get a permanent address which means when you restart the agent, you will need to send a new address to your players.
